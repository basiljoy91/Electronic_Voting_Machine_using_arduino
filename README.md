# Electronic_Voting_Machine_using_arduino

## Project Overview.

   An Electronic Voting Machine is used to make the voting system more efficient. Unlike the previous paper ballot system, this doesn't use many resources instead it uses digital control and signalling protocols. In this project, we are using Arduino to build a simulation of the same. Here it can record the votes of a maximum of three candidates and determine the result like win, tie etc... Use a 16x2 LCD panel for the output and push buttons for the input. It has two units, a Control and a Ballot unit. The ballot unit is where people can cast their votes and the control unit is where the counting, verification and other similar processes happen.

## How to use.

   1. Power the system.
   2. Votes can be cast to respective candidates using the "Can_A", "Can_B" and Can_C" Push buttons. (If the vote is cast successfully, the Ballot unit will buzz with a light indicator to the respective candidate and the control unit show "vote cast" on the display.
   3. The "Total" button can be used to see the total polling even in between the process.
   4. The "Close" button can be used to end the process, which means no more votes can be cast.
   5. The "Result" button shows the individual candite votes and other statuses like win, tie etc... ("Result" will only work after the "Close").
   6. The "Clear" button can be used to erase the memory and start a new one.
